# SNHU-CS330
When designing software, I usually start with looking at the requirements to see what the main point of the software will be. I then usually try to break down each requirement into smaller chunks to work on so that not everything is needed to be done all at once. In the case of this project, it worked out perfectly because we built on it little by little each week until we reached the final product. That made working on this project a lot easier. I then integrated the requirements step by step into the code, it was a bit more difficult to develop the program since this is something I had never done before. The hardest part of this development process was having to start and stop everytime I wanted to slightly change the positioning or the scale of each object. It was a bit time consuming so that could be something that I could work on in the future but it was fine overall/
This course showed me that there are many different areas of Software Development and not just the one I currently work in. It made me really appreciative of the work the visual developers do to create a variety of different visual spectacles. I started looking into Visual Development because I actually used to work as an x-ray tech so being able to combine the 2 fields would be amazing. We relied heavily on the visual model that was shown after we took the x-ray. This slight skill that I made helped me look at what I would need to work on to achieve that dream. Very fun class!
